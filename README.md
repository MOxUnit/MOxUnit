# MOxUnit [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nno/MOxUnit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nno/MOxUnit)

MOxUnit is a lightweight unit test framework for Matlab and GNU Octave.

### Features

- Runs on both the [Matlab] and [GNU Octave] platforms.
- Uses object oriented TestCase, TestSuite and TestResult classes, allowing for user-defined extensions.
- Can be used directly with continuous integration services, such as [Travis-ci].
- Supports JUnit-like XML output.
- Provides compatibility with Steve Eddin's [Matlab xUnit test framework].
- Distributed under the MIT license, a permissive free software license.


### Installation

- Using the shell (requires a Unix-like operating system such as GNU/Linux or Apple OSX):

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MOxUnit/MOxUnit.git
    cd MOxUnit
    make install
    ```
    This will add the MOxUnit directory to the Matlab and/or GNU Octave searchpath. If both Matlab and GNU Octave are available on your machine, it will install MOxUnit for both.

- Manual installation:

    + Download the zip archive from the [MOxUnit] website.
    + Start Matlab or GNU Octave.
    + On the Matlab or GNU Octave prompt, `cd` to the `MOxUnit` root directory, then run:
    
        ```matlab
        cd MOxUnit          % cd to MOxUnit subdirectory
        moxunit_set_path()  % add the current directory to the Matlab/GNU Octave path
        savepath            % save the path
        ```

### Running MOxUnit tests

- `cd` to the directory where the unit tests reside. For MOxUnit itself, the unit tests are in the directory `tests`.
- run the tests using `moxunit_runtests`. For example, running `moxunit_runtests` from MOxUnit's `tests` directory should give the following output:
  ```
  suite: 27 tests
  ...........................
  --------------------------------------------------

  OK
  ans =

       1
  ```

- `moxunit_runtests`, by default, gives non-verbose output and runs all tests in the current directory. This can be changed using the following arguments:
  - `-verbose`: show verbose output.
  - `directory`: run unit tests in directory `directory`.
  - `file.m`: run unit tests in file `file.m`.
  - `-logfile logfile.txt`: store the output in file `logfile.txt`.
  - `-junit_xml xmlfile`: store JUnit-like XML output in file `xmlfile`.

- To test MOxUnit itself using a shell, run:
    ```
    make test
    ```

### Use with travis-ci
MOxUnit uses the [Travis-ci] service for continuous integration testing. This is achieved by setting up a [.travis.yml configuration file](.travis.yml). As a result, the test suite is run automatically every time it is pushed to the github repository, or when a pull request is made. If a test fails, or if all tests pass after a test failed before, the developers are notified by email.

### Defining MOxUnit tests

To define unit tests, write a function with the following header:
```matlab
function test_suite=my_test_of_abs
    initTestSuite;
```

*Important*: it is crucial that the output of the main function is called `test_suite`.

Then, define subfunctions whose name start with `test_` or end with `_test`. These functions can use the following `assert*` functions:
- `assertTrue(a)`: assert that `a` is true.
- `assertFalse(a)`: assert that `a` is false.
- `assertEqual(a,b)`: assert that `a` and `b` are equal.
- `assertElementsAlmostEqual(a,b)`: assert that the floating point arrays `a` and `b` have the same size, and that corresponding elements are equal within some numeric tolerance.
- `assertVectorsAlmostEqual(a,b)`: assert that floating point vectors `a` and `b` have the same size, and are equal within some numeric tolerance based on their vector norm.
- `assertExceptionThrown(f,id)`: assert that calling `f()` throws an exception with identifier `id`. (To deal with cases where Matlab and GNU Octave throw errors with different identifiers, use `moxunit_util_platform_is_octave`).

As a special case, `moxunit_throw_test_skipped_exception('reason')` throws an exception that is caught when running the test; `moxunit_run_tests` will report that the test is skipped for reason `reason`.

For example, the following function defines three unit tests that tests some possible inputs from the builtin `abs` function:
```matlab
function test_suite=my_test_of_abs
    initTestSuite

function test_abs_scalar
    assertTrue(abs(-1)==1)
    assertEqual(abs(-NaN),NaN);
    assertEqual(abs(-Inf),Inf);
    assertEqual(abs(0),0)
    assertElementsAlmostEqual(abs(-1e-13),0)

function test_abs_vector
    assertEqual(abs([-1 1 -3]),[1 1 3]);

function test_abs_exceptions
    % GNU Octave and Matlab use different error identifiers
    if moxunit_util_platform_is_octave()
        assertExceptionThrown(@()abs(struct),'');
    else
        assertExceptionThrown(@()abs(struct),...
                             'MATLAB:UndefinedFunction');
    end
```

Examples of unit tests are in MOxUnit's `tests` directory, which test some of MOxUnit's functions itself.

### Compatibility notes
- Because GNU Octave 3.8 does not support `classdef` syntax, 'old-style' object-oriented syntax is used for the class definitions. For similar reasons, MOxUnit uses the `lasterror` function, even though its use in Matlab is discouraged.


### Acknowledgements
- The object-oriented class structure was inspired by the [Python unit test] framework.
- The `assert*` function signatures are aimed to be compatible with Steve Eddin's [Matlab xUnit test framework].


### Limitations
Currently MOxUnit does not support:
- Documentation tests (these would require `evalc`, which is not available on `GNU Octave` as of January 2014).
- Support for setup and teardown functions in `TestCase` classes.
